# **Meeting Conclusion:** 
Today's meeting was a productive checkpoint for the team. We successfully assigned roles and divided the team into 3 teams. With these 3 teams, it will be easier to organize tasks based on the roles that we need to do. At the same time, we also had some tasks that were not labeled, so those were the most important ones so we can start the project.
