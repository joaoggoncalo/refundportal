# <a name="_toc152519739"></a>Stakeholder analysis
The process of stakeholder analysis plays an important to make the project successfull. It is important in ensuring the efficient allocation of resources, communication, mitigating potential risks, and securing the essential support and consent required for project progression. In collaboration with the client, certain stakeholders were identified (figure X).

In this analysis, stakeholders are evaluated based on two critical dimensions: their level of power and their level of interest. This dual-axis evaluation allows us to categorize stakeholders into distinct groups, each with its unique implications and strategies for engagement.

Stakeholder Categories:

**Primary Stakeholders**: These are individuals or entities directly impacted, either positively or negatively, by the outcomes of the project. They are at the most important that we take in consideratio, as their needs and expectations significantly shape the direction and execution of our project.

**Secondary Stakeholders**: These stakeholders are indirectly affected by the project. Their involvement and influence, though not direct, are crucial in the broader context of project impact and sustainability.

**Tertiary Stakeholders**: This group experiences the least impact from the project. Understanding their perspective, however, can provide valuable insights into the extended implications of our project and help in foreseeing long-term effects.

Additionally, we also recognize the presence of:

**Key Stakeholders:** These are stakeholders who possess significant influence or hold a position of importance within the organizational context. They may overlap with the primary, secondary, or tertiary groups but are distinguished by their high level of influence or critical importance to the project.

Fig X. Stakeholder analysis

**Managed Closely:** The stakeholders categorized under "Manage Closely" in the power-interest matrix are those with high power and high interest regarding the project. Their active involvement and significant influence on the project's results necessitate a strategic approach to managing these relationships. It is needed to engage them deeply, integrate them into the decision-making loop, and address their inputs and concerns with priority.

**Keep Informed:** Those positioned in the "Keep Informed" position possess high interest yet lower power. Their insights and foresight could be invaluable, offering guidance and alerting to upcoming challenges. Maintaining open communication channels with these stakeholders is advantageous, ensuring they are updated and consulted regularly.

**Keep Satisfied:** Stakeholders placed in the "Keep Satisfied" section hold considerable importance over the project due to their high power, despite their lower level of interest. They command resources or authority that could impact the project's trajectory. Ensuring their requirements are met and their support is sustained is crucial for the project successfulness.

**Monitor:** Those in the "Monitor" position are characterized by both low power and low interest in relation to the project. Extensive engagement with these stakeholders isn't necessary; however, periodic reviews of their position and potential influence are important to prevent any unexpected developments.

# <a name="_toc111100001"></a>Code of Conduct


The task of developing a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) system for MyShop has been assigned to our team. It's crucial for us to maintain a unified understanding of the expected behaviors and values within our team to ensure the delivery of a superior product. To facilitate this, we have established a code of conduct that clearly defines the expectations and standards we are committed to upholding. This document serves as an exhaustive guide to our code of conduct. Its purpose is to cultivate a work environment characterized by positivity and respect, enhance our communication and collaboration, and guarantee that our efforts are in line with the needs of the client. Our adherence to this code of conduct is a testament to our dedication to each other, our university, our client, and the overall success of this project.



*Communication*

As a team, it is needed to acknowledge the significance of maintaining professional and respectful communication in all our interactions. This entails employing suitable language and tone, promptly responding to emails and messages, and keeping the team informed about progress and challenges. The aim is to uphold a communication style that is both professional and respectful, not only with our client but also amongst ourselves.

We use various communication channels, including WhatsApp and Discord, as well as in-person meetings in classes. Communication with the teacher is primarily done in classes, through Microsoft Teams chat and email, while communication with the client is done through email.

If the need arises to send a letter to the client, the content and purpose must be discussed and approved by most of the team. All team members' emails and names should be included in the signature.

Team members are expected to acknowledge and respond to messages within a 48-hour window. This ensures that everyone is informed and can contribute effectively to ongoing discussions and decision-making processes.

In case of non-performance of a task we will use strikes as disciplinary actions:

- First Strike (Warning): If a team member fails to fulfill their assigned tasks or responsibilities, they will receive a first strike, serving as a formal warning. This is to encourage improvement and adherence to the team's standards.
- Second Strike (Grade Penalty): If there is a repeated instance of non-performance, the team member will receive a second strike, which will result in a reduction of their grade for the project. This emphasizes the seriousness of their commitment to the team's success.
- Third Strike (Removal from Team): In the event of a third instance of non-compliance or non-performance, the team member will be removed from the project. This action underscores the importance of consistent contribution and reliability within the team.

*Time Management*

Acknowledging the vital role of time management in our project's success, we commit to maintaining punctuality and meeting deadlines in each sprint. Team members are expected to communicate proactively if they foresee any inability to meet a deadline and should seek help when needed. Additionally, if unable to attend a meeting due to a valid reason, team members should notify their colleagues ahead of time. Persistent unexcused absences will lead to disciplinary actions, such as receiving a strike.



*Cooperation and Conflict Resolution*

Our team places a high emphasis on cooperative efforts and positive critique. We encourage each member to contribute ideas, genuinely consider the perspectives of others, and endorse their fellow team members' input. In case conflicts or challenges arise, it's expected that team members will communicate these issues to the group and seek support when needed. Our goal is to address conflicts through transparent and respectful dialogue, aiming to reach solutions that are agreeable to all involved.

*Respect*

Our team is devoted to interacting with each other with respect, thoughtfulness, and an appreciation for our diverse backgrounds, skills, and experiences. We firmly prohibit any form of discrimination, whether it's based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability. Any negative or aggressive behaviors, including insults and violence, towards team members are strictly not tolerated. We endeavor to uphold an environment of tolerance, respect, and equality among our team members.

*Accountability*

Every member of our team is accountable for their individual work and dedicated to fulfilling their duties to the team and assigned tasks. We uphold a commitment to transparency in both our communication and work processes. Engaging in plagiarism or any form of academic dishonesty is strictly against our principles.

*Code Quality*

Each team member is dedicated to developing high-quality code that is thoroughly documented, tested, and aligns with the client's specifications. We conduct code reviews to verify that our code adheres to the necessary standards, and we offer constructive feedback to enhance its quality.

The objective of this code of conduct is to foster a positive, secure, and efficient work atmosphere for all team members. By following these guidelines, we showcase our collective commitment to one another, the client, and the successful completion of the project.
